# RawToGeos
Covert RAW audio file to Geos file format

This is a reserve enginerring of code I wrote back in the 80's long since lost but found online in archvies of files uploaded to the QuantumLink GEOS file section. Basicly all this code does is create a Geos file header and make a regulator commodore disk file to one with a GEOS header and Icon. This was as I remember code I gleamed from the GEOS Programmers Manual. Nothing fancy. For reference a "RAW" file was a sound file that was encoded and could be played through the SID chip. These where normally loaded into the RAM expansion cartridge to play as they could be huge.
